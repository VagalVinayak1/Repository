<p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
     elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a 
     certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to 
     somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 
     For example, take the following line of content:</p>

<h3>Multimedia and embedding</h3>
<p>This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including 
     the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and 
     even entire other webpages.</p>

         <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to
             W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously,
              which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1,
               CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.</p>


         <p>From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules
             started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately 
             per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest
              stable state of the CSS specification</p>

       <p>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, 
            it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code.
             This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine 
             (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</p>
      

      <p>java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on 
           many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.Portable Being architecture-neutral and having no 
           implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The compiler in Java is written 
           in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.Robust Java makes an effort to eliminate 
           error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.Multithreaded
           With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.
            This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</p>

    <p>Component-Based
     Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
     Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your 
     app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>

     react can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.</p>
